# JACS_ML_Tutorial

Basic introduction and a simple short ML tutorial on Machine Learning for the 
the JBCA (Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics) Autumn Computing Sessions (JACS).

The tutorial and intro is given in the pdf file, that describes the jupyter notebook.
I fecommend downloading the .tgz data file for the tutorial.
